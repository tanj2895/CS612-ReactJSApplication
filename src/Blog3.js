    <p>Diwali is called the festival of lights! Rows of lamps are lit inside and outside homes and buildings for the holiday. Imagine how bright that must be!
      These lamps are called deepavali (say “deep-a-vallee”), which is where we get the word Diwali.
      The lights line the street and even are floated down rivers on little boats. Nowadays the traditional small lamps are joined by electric light displays and LEDs. 
      All these lights represent the triumph of light over dark and the power of good over evil.
