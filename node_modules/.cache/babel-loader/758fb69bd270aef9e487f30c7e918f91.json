Among Hindus the most widespread custom is the lighting of diyas (small earthenware lamps filled with oil) on the night of the new moon to invite the presence of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. In Bengal the goddess Kali is worshipped. In North India the festival also celebrates the royal homecoming of Rama (along with Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman) to the city of Ayodhya after defeating Ravana, the 10-headed king of the demons, thus connecting the festival with the holiday of Dussehra. In South India the festival marks Krishna\\u2019s defeat of the demon Narakasura. Some celebrate Diwali as a commemoration of the marriage of Lakshmi and Vishnu, while others observe it as the birthday of Lakshmi. During the festival, diyas are lit and placed in rows along the parapets of temples and houses and set adrift on rivers and streams. Homes are decorated, and floors inside and out are covered with rangoli, consisting of elaborate designs made of coloured rice, sand, or flower petals. The doors and windows of houses are kept open in the hope that Lakshmi will find her way inside and bless the residents with wealth and success.\"))));\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default Main;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/tanvi/Desktop/Assignment4_CS612-master/src/Main.js"],"names":["React","Component","Link","Main","render","process","env","PUBLIC_URL"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,QAAiC,OAAjC;AACA,SACCC,IADD,QAEO,kBAFP;;AAIA,MAAMC,IAAN,SAAmBF,SAAnB,CAA6B;AAC3BG,EAAAA,MAAM,GAAG;AACP,WACC;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cADF,EAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACA,oBAAC,IAAD;AAAM,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,OAAhB;AAAwB,MAAA,KAAK,MAA7B;AAA8B,MAAA,EAAE,EAAC,QAAjC;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBADA,EAEA;AAAG,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,OAAb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,MAFA,EAGA;AAAK,MAAA,GAAG,EAAEC,OAAO,CAACC,GAAR,CAAYC,UAAZ,GAAyB,cAAnC;AAAoD,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,kBAAxD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,MAHA,EAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,g0CAJA,CADA,EAkBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACA,oBAAC,IAAD;AAAM,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,OAAhB;AAAwB,MAAA,KAAK,MAA7B;AAA8B,MAAA,EAAE,EAAC,QAAjC;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cADA,EAEA;AAAG,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,OAAb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,MAFA,EAGA;AAAK,MAAA,GAAG,EAAEF,OAAO,CAACC,GAAR,CAAYC,UAAZ,GAAyB,YAAnC;AAAkD,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,kBAAtD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,MAHA,EAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,4+CAJA,CAlBA,EA+BA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACA,oBAAC,IAAD;AAAM,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,OAAhB;AAAwB,MAAA,KAAK,MAA7B;AAA8B,MAAA,EAAE,EAAC,QAAjC;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gBADA,EAEA;AAAG,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,OAAb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,MAFA,EAGA;AAAK,MAAA,GAAG,EAAEF,OAAO,CAACC,GAAR,CAAYC,UAAZ,GAAyB,YAAnC;AAAkD,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,QAAtD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,MAHA,EAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,83DAJA,CA/BA,CAFA,CADD;AAkDD;;AApD0B;;AAuD7B,eAAeJ,IAAf","sourcesContent":["import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport {\r\n\tLink\r\n} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nclass Main extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n     <main>\r\n       <br>1233</br>\r\n     <ol>\r\n     <li>\r\n     <Link className=\"title\" exact to=\"/Blog1\">Sankrati</Link>\r\n     <p className=\"title\"></p>\r\n     <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/kitesss.jpg' } alt=\"Indian Festivals\"  />\r\n     <p>Makar Sankranti is celebrated on a fixed date that is 14 January every year. \r\n       It also marks the termination of the Winter season and the beginning of a new harvest season. \r\n       It is dedicated to Lord Sun.
