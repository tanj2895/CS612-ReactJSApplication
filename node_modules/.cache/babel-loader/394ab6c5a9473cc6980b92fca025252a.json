The burning of Holika prompts worshippers to remember how Vishnu (in the form of a lion-man, Narasimha) attacked and killed Hiranyakashipu, vindicating both Prahlada and Vishnu. The Holi festival commemorates the victory of good over evil, particularly the burning and destruction of a demoness named Holika.
