Participants throw coloured water and powders on one another, and, on this one day only, license is given for the usual rankings of caste, gender, status, and age to be reversed. In the streets the celebrations are often marked by ribald language and behaviour, but at its conclusion, when everyone bathes, dons clean white clothes, and visits friends, teachers, and relatives, the ordered patterns of society are reasserted and renewed. Holi is particularly enjoyed by worshippers of the god Krishna. Its general frivolity is considered to be in imitation of Krishna\\u2019s play with the gopis (wives and daughters of cowherds). In Vraja (modern Gokul), rituals of reversal culminate in a battle in which the women of the natal village of Radha, Krishna\\u2019s eternally devoted lover, pummel the men of Krishna\\u2019s village with staves; the men defend themselves with shields. In the Dolayatra (\\u201CSwing Festival\\u201D), images of the gods are placed on decorated platforms and are swung to the accompaniment of cycles of songs sung only in the spring season. In many locales, celebrants kindle an early morning bonfire that represents the burning of the demoness Holika (or Holi), who was enlisted by her brother, Hiranyakashipu, in his attempt to kill his son Prahlada because of the latter\\u2019s unshakable devotion to Vishnu. The burning of Holika prompts worshippers to remember how Vishnu (in the form of a lion-man, Narasimha) attacked and killed Hiranyakashipu, vindicating both Prahlada and Vishnu. The Holi festival commemorates the victory of good over evil, particularly the burning and destruction of a demoness named Holika. This was made possible with the help of Hindu god of preservation, Lord Vishnu. Holi got its name as the \\\"Festival of Colors\\\" from the childhood antics of Lord Krishna, a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu, who liked to play pranks on the village girls by drenching them in water and colors. Festivities occur throughout India but are more exuberant in some areas than others. To get an idea of what happens and where, check out these top ways and places to celebrate Holi in India. Traditional Holi celebrations are biggest in the Brij (also known as Braj) region of Uttar Pradesh about three hours from Delhi, where Lord Krishna is believed to have grown up. Mathura and Vrindavan are at the center of this region. The festivities extend for more than a week there. However, safety issues are a concern for women, due to the rowdy behavior of many local men. So, it's best to travel as part of a guided group tour. Rajasthan is a popular Holi destination for foreign tourists, particularly places such as Pushkar, Jaipur, and Udaipur. Many backpacker hostels organize Holi parties for guests there. Rajasthan Tourism also holds a special Holi festival in Jaipur. People spend the day smearing colored powder all over each other's faces, throwing colored water at each other, having parties, and dancing under water sprinklers. Bhang, a paste made from cannabis plants, is also traditionally consumed as part of the celebrations. Special Holi events with music, rain dances, and colors are organized in large cities across India\\u2014particularly in Delhi and Mumbai. It's possible to celebrate Holi with a local Indian family in Delhi and in Jaipur through Tripadvisor. The emphasis of Holi rituals is on the burning of demoness Holika. On Holika Dahan, large bonfires are lit to mark occasion. As well as conducting a special puja (worship ritual), people sing and dance around the fire, and walk around it three times. In some parts of India, people even walk across the hot coals of the fire! Such fire walking is considered to be sacred. One place where it happens is Saras village near Surat in Gujarat. The destruction of Holika is mentioned in the Hindu text, the Narada Purana. Holika's brother, the demon King Hiranyakashyap, apparently wanted her to burn his son, Prahlad, because he followed Lord Vishnu and didn't worship him. Holika sat with Prahlad in her lap, in the burning fire, because it was thought that no fire could harm her. However, Prahlad survived because his devotion to Lord Vishnu protected him. Holika was instead charred to death. A priest in Falen village, near Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, says his village is where the mythological tale of Holika actually took place. Apparently, local priests have been walking through the raging fire unscathed there for hundreds of years. Since they don't get hurt, they're considered to be an incarnation of Prahlad and blessed by him. The priest admitted that he undertakes a lengthy period of meditation and preparation before the remarkable feat though. Unlike most other festivals in India, there aren't any religious rituals to be performed on the main day of Holi. It's simply a day for having fun! As Holi provides an opportunity to disregard social norms and generally \\\"let loose\\\", males commonly take it too far and act disrespectfully. Single women should avoid going out alone in public places during Holi, as inebriated young Indian guys often pose a safety threat. These males, who have consumed excessive amounts of bhang and other intoxicants, will inappropriately touch women and make a nuisance of themselves. They are usually in groups and can be very aggressive. Incidents of rape also do occur, which makes it important to take proper care during Holi. If you plan on going out into the streets on Holi, do so early in the morning. Be back in your hotel by midday before the men get too inebriated. Many hotels hold special Holi parties for their guests in a safe environment. Expect to have colored powder and water rubbed and thrown onto your face, mouth and ears. Keep your mouth shut and protect your eyes as much as possible.\"));\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default Blog2;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/tanvi/Desktop/Assignment4_CS612-master/src/Blog2.js"],"names":["React","Component","Blog2","render","process","env","PUBLIC_URL"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,QAAiC,OAAjC;;AAEA,MAAMC,KAAN,SAAoBD,SAApB,CAA8B;AAC5BE,EAAAA,MAAM,GAAG;AACP,WAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OAAI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAAJ,CADA,EAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OAAQ;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,MAAf;AAAsB,MAAA,GAAG,EAAEC,OAAO,CAACC,GAAR,CAAYC,UAAZ,GAAyB,aAApD;AAAoE,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,MAAxE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,MAAR,CAFA,EAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,qwLAJA,CAFA;AAmCD;;AArC2B;;AAwC9B,eAAeJ,KAAf","sourcesContent":["import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass Blog2 extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n    \r\n    <main>\r\n    <h1><screenLeft>Holi</screenLeft></h1>\r\n    <center><img className=\"blog\" src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/Holi1.jpeg' } alt=\"Holi\"  /></center>\r\n\r\n    <p>Holi, Hindu spring festival celebrated throughout North India on the full-moon day of Phalguna (February–March). \r\n      Participants throw coloured water and powders on one another, and, on this one day only, license is given for the usual rankings of caste, gender, status, \r\n      and age to be reversed.
